## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling through the AWS Management Console. You'll create a launch template that defines your EC2 instances and an Auto Scaling group with a single instance in it. After launching your Auto Scaling group, you'll terminate the instance and verify that the instance was removed from service and replaced. To maintain a constant number of instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects and responds to Amazon EC2 health and reachability checks automatically.
